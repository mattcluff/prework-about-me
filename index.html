      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm taking the UofA coding boot camp and my goal is to to master coding and turn it into a new career</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Mesa, Arizona (born and raised)</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Currently addicted to Old School Runescape, a medieval fantasy mmorpg (ign: Mastered1020) and play it with my wife and irl friends. Geocaching and spending time with my 2 children. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To become a developer, still undecided between software/web</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Still Mesa, Arizona</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>From an early age, when asked I'd say that I wanted to either go into computers, or teaching. Teaching isn't a profession that sustains a family well enough and I was turned off by the Computer Science degree route after so many who have those degrees have told me that they aren't too familiar with web dev or many of the languages covered in this program. I want a relvant skill set that will help me get into a career that is long lasting and this program will be the first step in that journey. </p>
